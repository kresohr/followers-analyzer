# Follower Analyzer

## What is Follower Analyzer?

It is a simple tool that you run locally to check which users are **NOT** following you back on Instagram.

## How it works?

Follow these steps:

- Open the Instagram application
- Go to your profile
- Press on the "three lines" in the upper right corner
- Select 'Accounts Center'
- Select 'Your information and permission' in the Account Settings section
- Select 'Download your information'
- Select 'Download or transfer information'
- Select "Some of your information"
- Scroll down and select only "Followers and following" checkbox.
- Select 'Next'
- Select either 'Download to device' or 'Transfer to destination'
- For the date range, select 'All time'
- For the format, select 'JSON'
- Select 'Next'

Your files will become available on that screen within 24 hours, come back and you'll see a "download" button. Once you download the files, transfer them to the device you'll be uploading from. This file will be uploaded to the project you are going to run and it will show you a list of profiles which are not following you back.
